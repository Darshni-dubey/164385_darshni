<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <p>The common belief is that Italians invented 
pizza, but a baked bread with toppings has many other precursors in 
other cuisines. Italy’s version of the dish, especially from Naples, 
is the one we are most familiar with, though pissaladière from 
Provence, coca from Catalan, and lahma bi ajeen from the Middle East
 all bear a remarkable resemblance to pizza.
Supposedly, this archetypal pizza, an open-faced pie slathered in 
tomato sauce and mozzarella, was ushered in by the baker Raffaele 
Esposito in Naples. In 1889, he made a patriotic pie topped with 
mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes, ingredients in the colors of the 
Italian flag, in honor of King Umberto and Queen Margherita’s visit. 
It is rumored the Queen enjoyed the pie, and thus, it became known as
a Margherita.
In the US, Italian immigrants sold pizza in their stores, and the 
first pizzeria was opened in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi at 53 1/3 Spring 
Street in New York City, but pizza did not truly not catch on stateside
until World War II. Stationed in Italy, many American and European 
soldiers tasted pizza and brought an appetite for this now-ubiquitous
dish home with them.
Yum.</p>

<td bgcolor="#FF0000"><p>The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th 
century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta 
in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[2] Modern pizza was invented in
 Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in 
many countries.[3] Today it is one of the most popular foods in the 
world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, 
available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), 
restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.
Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an 
ordinary home oven.</p>
